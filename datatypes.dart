// Lists (List, also known as arrays)
// Sets (Set)

// Runes (Runes; often replaced by the characters API)
// Symbols (Symbol)

// Some other types also have special roles in the Dart language:

// Object: The superclass of all Dart classes except Null.
// Enum: The superclass of all enums.
// Future and Stream: Used in asynchrony support.
// Iterable: Used in for-in loops and in synchronous generator functions.
// Never: Indicates that an expression can never successfully finish evaluating. Most often used for functions that always throw an exception.
// dynamic: Indicates that you want to disable static checking. Usually you should use Object or Object? instead.
// void: Indicates that a value is never used. Often used as a return type.
